The NASA Exoplanet Explorer program is a Python application designed to provide informative stories about exoplanets beyond our solar system. Utilizing the ChatGPT API and data from the NASA Exoplanet TAP service, the program dynamically generates narratives based on key attributes of each exoplanet, such as its name, orbital period, distance from its host star, and equilibrium temperature. These narratives offer depictions of what these distant worlds might be like, ranging from serene habitable planets to harsh landscapes. The program can be interacted with through a simple GUI, where the generation of new exoplanets can be triggered.
